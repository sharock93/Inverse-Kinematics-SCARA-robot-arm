% Gradient-Descent method for the problem of numerical inverse kinematics on a two-link robot arm

% The goal with forward kinematics is to find the location/orientation of the end 
% effector of an arm with joint angles + displacement as input. The goal with inverse 
% kinematics is to take the desired location/orientation of the end effector as input 
% and find the joint angles + displacements needed to get to this location.

% Inverse kinematics is more complicated than forward kinematics due to the possibility 
% of multiple solution or no solutions. An example of multiple solutions would be an arm 
% with extra degrees of freedom being able to get to the same orientation in multiple 
% different ways. Some examples of no solutions would be a position that is far away from 
% the arm and therefore out of reach, or a position that the arm cannot get to without 
% colliding with itself.

% Jacobian Matrix: The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of all the first order partial
% derivatives of a vector function.

% This means that the Jacobian matrix describe how each coordinate changes with respect
% to each joint angle in our system. It describes the first order linear approximation between
% these arguments.

%% Function instructions:
% Put:
% a1,a2 : Robot arm lenght
% X1d,X2d: End effector points
% theta_1,theta_2: Starting point angle
% rate: Learning rate
% call function: [count,start_eff,cost] = Gradient_Descent(1,1,.1,1.5, 0.2,0.6,30)
function [count,start_eff,cost] = Gradient_Descent(a1,a2,X1d,X2d,theta_1,theta_2,rate)
% Counter for number of Iterations
count = 0;

% Calculate Initial starting points using Forward Kinematics
X1 = a1*cosd(theta_1) + a2*cosd(theta_1+theta_2);
X2 = a1*sind(theta_1) + a2*sind(theta_1+theta_2);

% Finding Jacobian Matrix 
Jacobian = [-a1*sind(theta_1)-a2*sind(theta_1+theta_2), -a2*sind(theta_1+theta_2);
            a1*cosd(theta_1)+a2*cosd(theta_1+theta_2), a2*cosd(theta_1+theta_2)];

% Vector matrix of desired location of robotic arm
end_eff = [X1d;X2d];

% Vector matrix of starting point of robotic arm 
start_eff = [X1;X2];

% Vector matrix of starting potint angle of robotic arm

% Error related to end effector and starting point
error = start_eff-end_eff;

% Cost function based on euclidean distance of end effector and starting point

    trans_jacob = transpose(Jacobian)% transpose of Jacobian
    theta_eff = theta_eff - (rate)*(trans_jacob)*(error)  % qk+1 = qk-lr*transpose(j)*(f(q)-xd)
    cost = sqrt((end_eff(1,1)-start_eff(1,1))^2+(end_eff(2,1)-start_eff(2,1))^2) % Euclidean distance
